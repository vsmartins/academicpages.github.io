# About me

Hello! I’m Vitor Martins, a young scientist in remote sensing topic. I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural and Environmental Eng. from the Federal University of Vicosa in 2014 (Brazil), and Master’s degree in Remote sensing at National Institute for Space Research in 2017. I also worked as a GIS specialist in the industry for 6 months. Currently I’m a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University (EUA). My research interest is focused on satellite applications using multi-spectral data, such as Landsat OLI, Sentinel MSI and Terra MODIS. So far, I had worked on the atmospheric correction approaches and validation of MODIS atmospheric retrievals at regional and global scales. A central aspect of my work includes efficient data handling and a lot of image processing to answer multi-disciplinary questions about landscape and atmospheric dynamic. 

My hobbies include playing soccer, running, Netflix and eating cheese with Tostitos.

This study provides a relevant information for remote sensing community about atmospheric correction for CBERS MUX dataset. Although CBERS is a long-term Earth Observation program (~30 years), there are few publications about this dataset in peer-review journals. We believe that our findings are helpful to inform the recent progress in the atmospheric correction algorithm for multi-spectral MUX sensor.

Abstract
A practical atmospheric correction algorithm, called Coupled Moderate Products for Atmospheric Correction (CMPAC), was developed and implemented for the Multispectral Camera (MUX) on-board the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4). This algorithm uses a scene-based processing and sliding window technique to derive MUX surface reflectance (SR) at continental scale. Unlike other optical sensors, MUX instrument imposes constraints for atmospheric correction due to the absence of spectral bands for aerosol estimation from imagery itself. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm performs a further processing of atmospheric products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors as input parameters for radiative transfer calculations. The success of CMPAC algorithm was fully assessed and confirmed by comparison of MUX SR data with the Landsat-8 OLI Level-2 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived SR products. The spectral adjustment was performed to compensate for the differences of relative spectral response between MUX and OLI sensors. The results show that MUX SR values are fairly similar to operational Landsat-8 SR products (mean difference < 0.0062, expressed in reflectance). There is a slight underestimation of MUX SR compared to OLI product (except the NIR band), but the error metrics are typically low and scattered points are around the line 1:1. These results suggest the potential of combining these datasets (MUX and OLI) for quantitative studies. Further, the robust agreement of MUX and AERONET-derived SR values emphasizes the quality of moderate atmospheric products as input parameters in this application, with root-mean-square deviation lower than 0.0047. These findings confirm that (i) CMPAC is a suitable tool for estimating surface reflectance of CBERS MUX data, and (ii) ancillary products support the application of atmospheric correction by filling the gap of atmospheric information. The uncertainties of atmospheric products, negligence of the bidirectional effects, and two aerosol models were also identified as a limitation. Finally, this study presents a framework basis for atmospheric correction of CBERS-4 MUX images. The utility of CBERS data comes from its use, and this new product enables the quantitative remote sensing for land monitoring and environmental assessment at 20 m spatial resolution.
