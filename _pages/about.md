# About me

Hello! I’m Vitor Martins, a young scientist in satellite remote sensing. I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural and Environmental Eng. from the Federal University of Vicosa in 2014 (Brazil), and Master’s degree in Remote sensing at National Institute for Space Research in 2017. I also worked as a GIS analyst in the industry for 6 months. Currently, I’m a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU). My research interest is focused on satellite applications using multi-spectral data, such as Landsat OLI, Sentinel MSI and Terra MODIS. So far, I had worked on the atmospheric correction approaches and validation of MODIS atmospheric retrievals at regional and global scales. A central aspect of my work includes efficient data handling and image processing for land-atmosphere studies.

During my master, I had a great experience collecting field radiometric data in Mamiraua floodplain lakes [[**link**]](https://www.mamiraua.org.br/pt-br). This research was conducted by [**LabISA**](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/labisa/) team, under supervision of Dr. Claudio C.F. Barbosa and Dra. Evlyn M.L.M. Novo. The results of my thesis were partly available in this [**link**](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/atmc/index.php?LANGUAGE=EN). After that, I worked for six months in the industry (Imagem), involving remote sensing and python programming. Now, I'm doing a PhD in the ABE department under supervision of Dr. Kaleita. This department has great faculty team and giant structure for students - I appreciate all here [[**ABE**]](https://www.abe.iastate.edu/abe-department/about-abe/rankings/). By the way, my hobbies include playing soccer, running, Netflix and eating cheese with Tostitos.

# Recent News

* **November 25, 2018**: Global validation of MODIS-MAIAC (MCD19A2) water vapor against AERONET observations is coming soon. The results are relevant for MODIS water vapor community (I think so!).

Water vapor distribution from MODIS MCD19A2 product (lat: N60 - S60). The water vapor has a key role in the Earth’s climate system, and it is amazing to observe this seasonal change around the equator (ITCZ).

* **November 06, 2018**: Nice! A paper was accepted in the Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment - 
[*Remote sensing of large reservoir in the drought years: Implications on surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir (Northeast Brazil)*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2018.11.006). Beyond the technical aspects of this paper, I believe that more studies are needed to discuss the water crisis in the Northeast Brazil. The climate projections show an extreme vulnerability in this region, and the water resources will be a huge issue for local communities.
  <br />
  > **Research highlights**:
  <br />
  1) Critical surface water change caused by drought years between 2013 – 2017;
  <br /> 
  2) Regional precipitation analysis shows the rainfall deficit over catchment area;
  <br /> 
  3) The framework for continuous monitoring of Sobradinho during water shortage.

* **September 26, 2018**: Hard work, many challenges! A paper was accepted in the Remote Sensing of Environmental: [*Continental-scale surface reflectance product from CBERS-4 MUX data: Assessment of atmospheric correction method using coincident Landsat observations*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.09.017). 
This study provides a relevant information for remote sensing community about atmospheric correction for CBERS MUX dataset. Although CBERS is a long-term Earth Observation program (~30 years), there are few publications about this dataset in peer-review journals. We believe that our findings are helpful to inform the recent progress in the atmospheric correction algorithm for multi-spectral MUX sensor.
  <br />
  > **Research highlights**:
    <br />
    1) A practical approach was developed for atmospheric correction of CBERS-4 MUX data;
    <br />
    2) First assessment of CBERS-4 MUX surface reflectance across South America;
    <br />
    3) Moderate atmospheric products are used as ancillary products in the approach;
    <br />
    4) MUX surface reflectance (SR) was compared to Landsat-8 SR e AERONET-derived SR.

* **May 18, 2018**: Do you want to know more about atmospheric constituents in Amazon? This paper should help you - I hope. A paper was accepted in the ISPRS Journal: [*Seasonal and interannual assessment of cloud cover and atmospheric constituents across the Amazon (2000–2015): Insights for remote sensing and climate analysis*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.05.013). 
This study provides a seasonal distribution and variability of four atmospheric constituents in the Amazon basin. Since the climate forces are driving the atmospheric dynamic (and land), we observed strong variability in extreme El Nino and La Nina. This is a real chance to see the variability of both aerosol, clouds, water vapor and ozone across the region. Take a look.
  <br />
  > **Research highlights**:
    <br />
    1) Negative (positive) trends in AOD (CWV) anomalies were observed between 2000-2015;
    <br />
    2) The high variability of atmospheric constituents was observed in southern sub-basin rather than northern sub-basins (I expected);
    <br />
    3) July is a relatively cloud-free period under low aerosol loadings (good for RS applications!);
