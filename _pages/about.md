# About me

Hello! I’m Vitor Martins, a young scientist in remote sensing topic. I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural and Environmental Eng. from the Federal University of Vicosa in 2014 (Brazil), and Master’s degree in Remote sensing at National Institute for Space Research in 2017. I also worked as a GIS specialist in the industry for 6 months. Currently I’m a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University (EUA). My research interest is focused on satellite applications using multi-spectral data, such as Landsat OLI, Sentinel MSI and Terra MODIS. So far, I had worked on the atmospheric correction approaches and validation of MODIS atmospheric retrievals at regional and global scales. A central aspect of my work includes efficient data handling and a lot of image processing to answer multi-disciplinary questions about landscape and atmospheric dynamic. 

My hobbies include playing soccer, running, Netflix and eating cheese with Tostitos.

* **November 06, 2018**: A paper was accepted in the Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment - 
*Remote sensing of large reservoir in the drought years: Implications on surface water change and turbidity variability of Sobradinho reservoir (Northeast Brazil)*.


* **September 26, 2018**: A paper was accepted in the Remote Sensing of Environmental: *Continental-scale surface reflectance product from CBERS-4 MUX data: Assessment of atmospheric correction method using coincident Landsat observations*. This study provides a relevant information for remote sensing community about atmospheric correction for CBERS MUX dataset. Although CBERS is a long-term Earth Observation program (~30 years), there are few publications about this dataset in peer-review journals. We believe that our findings are helpful to inform the recent progress in the atmospheric correction algorithm for multi-spectral MUX sensor.
