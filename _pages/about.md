Hello! I’m Vitor Martins, a young scientist in remote sensing topic. I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural and Environmental Eng. from the Federal University of Vicosa in 2014 (Brazil), and Master’s degree in Remote sensing at National Institute for Space Research in 2017. I also worked as a GIS specialist in the industry for 6 months. Currently I’m a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University (EUA). My research interest is focused on satellite applications using multi-spectral data, such as Landsat OLI, Sentinel MSI and Terra MODIS. So far, I had worked on the atmospheric correction approaches and validation of MODIS atmospheric retrievals at regional and global scales. A central aspect of my work includes efficient data handling and a lot of image processing to answer multi-disciplinary questions about landscape and atmospheric dynamic.
